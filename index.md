Our project aims at improving the ArCo Knowledge Graph by adding triples that can both provide specifications about a piece of clothing (e.g. da cocktail, abito corto, drappeggio, fiocco…) and create new links between clothes and larger categories (e.g. paillettes). From our results, the project could work on a larger scale. Our propositions are the starting point for possible future developments.
